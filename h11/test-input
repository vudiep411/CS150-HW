CS 150 Test data for Homework 7

1. Single line comment removed
#include <iostream> // standard streams
#include <string> // standard string class

2. Comment embedded in a string
cout << "/* this is not a comment " << endl;

3. Strings in comments removed; single-line newlines retained
// Single line comment should be deleted
/* Paired comment should be deleted
   // Not really a comment
   "Not really a string\"    *****/
#include <iostream>  // Single line comment should be deleted

Test 4 - String-embedded comments retained
char * s = "Some text /* with an embedded */ // comment ";

Test 5 - Comment embedded in code line
int main(int argc /* argument count */, argv[] /* strings */)

Test 6 - Escaped quotes and comment embedded in code
string s = "\"hello\""; /* cmt1 */ string s2 = "bye"; /* cmt2 */

Test 7 - More escaped quotes in a string
string s = "\"//not a comment\"//not a comment";

Test 8 - DOXYGEN comments removed
int a=3;

// A C++ comment with a C-style comment marker /* in the middle
This is plain text under C++ (C99) commenting - but comment body otherwise
// A C++ comment with a C-style comment end marker */ in the middle

Note that C++ comments can appear   // at the end of a line
And the issue then is how should    // the newline be handled
when the options -c or -n or both   // or neither are in use
Should the newline be treated as    // part of the comment
or should it be deleted so that     // text is run on altogether

"And escaped double quotes at the end of a string\""
